Wow!
Michelle: I don’t think I can remember it well. But I can try. It was something very simple, but it was the sweetest thing I had ever eaten. The taste is unlike any other. I hope it makes sense, does it?

-> Gosh!
-> Incredible!
-> I'm amazed!

Anyway, time to get writing!

Clerk: Welcome to Lost Fawn Store. Are you browsing, or looking for something more… specific, perhaps?
Michelle: Who… are you?
Clerk: I am but a humble clerk. Could you tell me what brought you here?
Michelle: I guess it was… something mundane, but also close.
Clerk: Could you describe it to me in more detail, ma’am?

Michelle: I don’t think I can remember it well. But I can try. It was something very simple, but it was the sweetest thing I had ever eaten. The taste is unlike any other. I hope it makes sense, does it?
Clerk: That is indeed quite interesting. But of course, ma'am. Just wait here, please.
Clerk: <i>The sweetest thing ever, huh? I could try the Nostalgic Flavors Mall.</i>

Michelle: It does not feel right. It just does not belong to me.

Michelle: I never had a good relationship with my mother. Damn, I really don't think my mother had good relationships with her mother either. 
Michelle: That kind of sucks, that in a way, it always felt like the way the world is, but also not the way it should be. But whenever my mother brought me peeled fruit, I felt like the world is the way it should be, for once.
Michelle: When I come back home, she and I, are no more than spiders in a cage, fighting over control. But we always end up coming back to each other.
Michelle: There is… a specific feeling, when you realize something that seemed insignificant to you is very significant to someone else.
Michelle: I think… this is how I feel when we argue once again and she brings me sliced tangerine, over and over again. 
Michelle: Like a fragmented puzzle made complete for a second.
Clerk: I understand, ma’am. There are different things different people will do to show their affection.
Michelle: I guess what they say is true.
Clerk: I do not believe we are finished yet, however. There is something else that keeps bothering you, ma’am. How about the last one for the road?
Michelle: Yes. I am not done yet.
Michelle: It was a story. First, a word, in the empty space, then an animal, running and jumping. My watercolor picture, coming alive.
Clerk: I think I know who you are talking about.
Clerk: Anything related to stories usually goes to the Lost Media Library.

Michelle: This is the first book I have ever drawn for. It went out of print long since, and I lost my own copy.
Michelle: I am a children’s book illustrator, you see.
Michelle: I loved drawing as a child. My parents thought it was a waste of time, though.
Michelle: Sometimes I was thinking that, as well. But they say the first thing always makes you proud - and it did.
Michelle: When I get off work, the job is done and the day becomes a night, the feeling of creating things for others makes me… happy, in the purest way.
Michelle: I am not a believer, but it feels almost holy. Almost.
Clerk: I see you enjoy painting in watercolor. If I can, that seems quite old-fashioned.
Michelle: A lot of people say so. It is quite easier to work with digital tools, but they are not quite so good for giving you a true watercolor feel.
Michelle: But for me, watercolor pushes me to take more… decisive choices when I draw and paint.
Clerk: How so?
Michelle: Well, the moment your brush - or - your pen, touches the page, any opportunity to avoid a mistake has already passed.
Michelle: All you can and all you have to do is to commit to your decision and let it play out. And then, if mistakes are made, the only thing you can do is accept them and move on.
Clerk: You are also ready to move on, are you not?
Michelle: Yes. I am ready.

<color=\#b07972>A sweet fruit, peeled and prepared by someone who loved and cared very, very much. It induces an intoxicating citrus aroma. Must have been something meaningful for someone.</color>
